# Stock-Market-Price-Predictor-LSTM-LAYERS-
This Python script leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices with precision, utilizing historical data from Yahoo Finance. The Sequential LSTM model excels at capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, making it well-suited for time series forecasting.

Key features include hyperparameter tuning through grid search, optimizing epochs, batch size, and prediction days to enhance predictive performance. Additionally, the script incorporates bootstrap resampling to quantify prediction uncertainty, providing a range of potential outcomes for effective risk assessment.

The real-time prediction functionality empowers users with timely insights into the predicted stock price for the next day. To use the script, install dependencies with 'pip install -r requirements.txt', then execute it, adjusting parameters such as the target company, start date, and end date.

Visualizations depicting actual versus predicted stock prices are automatically saved as images for convenient performance assessment. This project serves as an educational tool, encouraging users to experiment with different parameters for fine-tuning and improving prediction accuracy.

It is essential to note that this project is intended for educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Users are encouraged to explore and understand the intricacies of LSTM-based stock price prediction, fostering a deeper comprehension of its applications and limitations.
