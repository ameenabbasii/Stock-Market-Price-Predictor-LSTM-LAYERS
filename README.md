Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This Python script employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices accurately using historical data from Yahoo Finance. The LSTM architecture excels at capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data, making it well-suited for time series forecasting.

Key Features:
LSTM Model: The script utilizes a Sequential LSTM neural network to analyze historical stock prices and make precise predictions.

Hyperparameter Tuning: An integrated grid search optimizes hyperparameters such as epochs, batch size, and prediction days, significantly enhancing the model's predictive performance.

Bootstrap Predictions: To quantify prediction uncertainty, the script employs bootstrap resampling, providing a range of potential outcomes and aiding in risk assessment.

Real-time Prediction: The script offers real-time predictions, providing insights into the predicted stock price for the next day and empowering users with timely information.

Usage:
Setup: Install necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the Script: Execute the script, adjusting parameters like the target company, start date, and end date.

Explore Results: View visualizations illustrating actual versus predicted stock prices. The script automatically saves these visualizations as images for convenient performance assessment.

This project serves as an educational tool for LSTM-based stock price prediction. Users are encouraged to experiment with different parameters for fine-tuning and improving prediction accuracy.
